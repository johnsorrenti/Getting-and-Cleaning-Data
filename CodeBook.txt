Code book for modified data set - Please see code book that comes with original data set for original specifications

Operations on data

1.) Read in features.txt
2.) Create a character vector using column 2 of features to be used as descriptive column names to lable x
3.) Read in activity labels
4.) Read in subject_train and subject_test
5.) Combine the rows of subject_train and subject_test
6.) Read in x_train and x_test
7.) Combine the rows of x_train and x_test
8.) Read in y_train and y_test
9.) Combine the rows of y_train and y_test
10.) y contains the activities as numbers for each observation join y with activity_labels to convert numbers to decriptive names
11.) Throw away number column leaving only descriptive names of activities for each observation
12.) Combine subject, activites and x into complete dataframe
13.) Label columns of new, complete data frame
14.) Extract only columns with mean and standard deviation while keeping Subjects and activities 
15.) Generate mean for all variables for all subjects for all activites and write it out to final data set


Subjects 
Each subject is represented by a number between 1 and 30

Activities
Each activity is assigned a number between 1 and 6 which also correspond to a descriptive character variable
1 WALKING

2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4 SITTING

5 STANDING

6 LAYING
 

Features

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]

Features included in the final data set only include those measuring the mean and standard deviation
