Code book for modified data set - Please see code book that comes with original data set for original specifications

###Was code book submitted to GitHub that modifies and updates the codebooks available to you with the data to indicate all the variables ###and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information?

Subjects 
Each subject is represented by a number between 1 and 30

Activities
Each activity is assigned a number between 1 and 6 which also correspond to a descriptive character variable
1 WALKING

2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4 SITTING

5 STANDING

6 LAYING
 


Features

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]

Features included in the final data set only include those measuring the mean and standard deviation
